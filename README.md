## Project Description
Road accidents continue to be a major global concern, causing significant loss of life, injuries, and economic impact.
In this project I have created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to analyse and visualize road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. 
The dashboard provides valuable insights into road safety metrics, aiding in understanding and analyzing various aspects of road accidents and casualties. 
Developed for our client, this dashboard aims to enhance awareness and decision-making related to road safety.

# Client Requirements  
The client wants to create a Road Dashboard for years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements:-
- **Primary KPI**- Total casualties taken place after the accident
- **Primary KPIs** - Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
- **Secondary KPIs**- Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type
- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
- Maximum casualties by Road Type
- Distribution of Total casualties by road surface
- Casualties by Location/Area
- Relation Between Casualties by Area / Location & by Day/Night

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors 
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Creating 2 new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.

## Data Analysis

Created a "Data Analysis" sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a new user or developer or client to ease their work and gathered information. On this sheet nine pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between number of casualties and many factors such as- casualty type, vehicle type, road type, location etc. Monthly trends were also analysed for the years 2021 and 2022.

Below is a snippet of the Data Analysis Sheet

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table. For user friendly and interactive experience slicers and timelines were incorporated. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary icons for seamless navigation.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.

## Key Insights

üìà Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals that a staggering 417,883 casualties occurred after accidents during the two-year period

üìÖ Peak Months: Overall the number of casulaties were slightly higher in 2021 than 2022. Maximum Casualties happened in the month of October and November in both the Years and minimum casualties take place in  the month of January and February.

üöó Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for the highest number of casualties, contributing to 79.8% of the total. On the other hand, casualties were minimal in accidents involving other vehicle types.

ü©∏ Casualties by accident severity Slight severity form the bulk of casualties 84.1% whereas there are only 1.7% Fatal severity casualties.

üõ£Ô∏è Road Type Analysis: Maximum Casualties by Single Carriageway road type (310.1K) and Minimum by Slip road(5.1K)

üåßÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: Highest Distribution of total casualties on Dry road surfaces (67%)

üèôÔ∏è Casualties Relation by Area/Location Urban areas form the majority of casualties after an accident (61%)

‚òÄÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by light condtion: 73% of casulties take place in daylight condtion

## Recommendations based on the Analysis

1.	By comparing casualty trends between the current and previous years on a monthly basis, the dashboard identifies critical periods of October and November. The road safety measure by the traffic police and other stakeholders must be active and focused during these high-risk periods. 
2.	Car drivers form bulk of the casualties so they must be targeted for awareness camps and strict monitoring, periodic check-ups on safe driving.
3.	Extra safety measures should be placed Single Carriageway roads and they must be upgraded to double lane wherever possible.
4.	Understanding casualty distribution based on different road surface conditions helps pinpoint areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are essential. 
5.	Urban areas should be targeted for interventions to improve road safety in specific and during daytime.

## End

This Road Accident Analytics Dashboard opens the door to data-driven decision-making, enabling stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions that enhance road safety. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates alike.
